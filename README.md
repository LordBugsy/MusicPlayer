(![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0d223e4-3057-4219-bdc7-d1143a4af4c1)


## Description
"MusicPlayer" allows you to play different songs within your web browser. You can add up to 10 songs in the playlist and listen to them in the background.
At the time I've pushed this project, it is currently unfinished. I will be updating it later. I've currently put 3 sample music in the audio folder.

## Features
- Select a song from your folder and add it in the playlist (Not implemented yet).
- Listen to a song in the background.
- Set the volume / loop
